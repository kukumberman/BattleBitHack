# BattleBitHack

First expreince in modding **Unity** games, started with using `Mono Injection` method in `BattleBit Remastered` game.

`25.12.2021` - game becomes compiled with **il2cpp** mode and there is no longer way to use mono injection (at least with method that I've tried) :cry:

Due to the reason above this is deprecated nowadays and serves for educational purposes.
